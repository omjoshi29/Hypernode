### How To Use:

First you have to have to go to the Home Page. There you can see a `chatbot`, you have to answer a few questions and then you will get a list of curated courses from the chatbot. On the courses page you can `filter` courses by platforms and `sort` courses by ratings. Clicking on `COMPARE` button redirects to compare page where you can compare the selected course with other courses.
